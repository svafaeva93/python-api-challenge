# Python-API - Weather Analysis and Choosing Vacation Spots 

Background
In this assignment, I was aksed to use my knowledge of Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Even though the answer may seem obvious, here I have used a detailed approach to answer this question. 

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.
